### Decrypto

>>>>>>> Adds comments, updates README
Final event as a part of IEEE Computer Society First year fest 2015-16.

### Details of the event
The event consists of a team divided into two parties - Encoder and 2*Decoders.

`Encoder`: 
Will be given an option to generate a random string of characters. They will be encrypted using one of the many encryption schemes provided to them. Ciphertext will be made public along with a comment which is supposed to be understood only to decoders from the same team.

>>>>>>> Adds comments, updates README

`Decoders`:
Will be given access to all the ciphers.

### Scoring system:

>>>>>>> Adds comments, updates README
* Generating a random word  `-5`<br>
* Solving your own cipher    `+10`<br>
* Solving other teams' cipher `+2`<br>
* If your cipher gets solved  `-1`<br>

### Setting up
Start `server.rb`.<br>
You can then start `encoder.rb` and `decoder.rb` as required.

### Contributing
1. Create a branch as -> `handle-dev` for example -> `chinmay_dd-dev`.
2. Create a PR to master. Make sure to include a simple changelog.
3. IMPORTANT - Master should contain only stable code.
4. Commit messages should be in present tense preferably.
5. Make sure to write decent comments for complex methods.
