### Decrypto
Final event as a part of IEEE Computer Society

### Details of the event
The event consists of a team divided into two parties -> Encoder and two decoders.

`Encoder`: 
Will be given an option to generate a random string of characters. They will be enciphered using one of the many encryption options provided to them. He will then make the ciphertext public along with a comment which is supposed to be understood only to decoders from the same team.

`Decoders`:
Will be given access to all the ciphers.

### Scoring system:

Generating a random word    - -5<br>
Solving your own cipher     - +10<br>
Solving other teams' cipher - +2<br>
If your cipher gets solved  - -1<br>

### Contributing
1. Create a branch as - `handle-dev` for example - `chinmay_dd-dev`.
2. Create a PR to master. Make sure to include a simple changelog.
3. IMPORTANT - Master should contain only stable code.
4. Commit messages should be in present tense preferably.
5. Make sure to write decent comments for complex methods.
